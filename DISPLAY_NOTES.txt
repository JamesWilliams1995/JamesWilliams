DISPLAY_CONTROLLED BY:
			RST (Hardware reset)
			CS  (chip select  to enables communication)
			RS  (Register select wherther Data=1/command=0)
			WR  (Lcd write)
			RD  (LCD read)
			Commucation Bus (parallel or protocol communication)

STEP:1
 >> First initialization 
   
	1.Software reset
	2.Display off
	3.Power control 1 or 2..   //contrast and brightness.
	4.VCOM Control 1 or 2...   //the liquid crystal display to balance the pixel driving voltages. which are used to stabilize the common electrode voltage.
	5.Inversion Control        //display for different viewing angles or reduce flickering.
	6.Memory access control (MADCTL) //the display is viewed, such as in portrait, landscape, or inverted modes.
	7.Pixel format			//to configure the number of bits per pixel and the color format.
	8.Frame rate control           //configures the division ratio and oscillation frequency to control the refresh rate of the display in normal mode.
	9.Entry mode set
	10.Display function control
	11. Positive gamma correction   // the contrast and color balance of the display. Gamma correction controls the luminance of pixels based on input values,
	12.Negative gamma correction    //the contrast and luminance of darker shades on the display. While positive gamma correction enhances lighter shades.
	13. Inversion                  //(i.e., black becomes white, red becomes cyan, etc.)
	14.Exit sleep mode             //When the display is in sleep mode, it consumes very little power but is not capable of displaying any images or data.
	15.Turn on the display         //commands to configure the display after exiting sleep mode and then enable the display
	16.Memory write        //command is used to write pixel data to the display memory (GRAM) of the LCD controller. 



STEP:2
     >> command write/ data write through gpio parallel to fillscreen rectangle color same for everything filling color procedure 


    first:  SC (start column)and EC (end column)
    secound:SP(start page) and EP (end page)
    third :  Memory write               // If the rectangle has dimensions of, say, 50 pixels wide by 60 pixels tall, you need to send the color data 3,000 times (50 Ã— 60 pixels).

   



DWIN HMI Display Project Steps:

1.Create a folder for project with required images and icons.
Images to be named 00, 01, 02, .... .bmp files and icons 00,01,02 .... .png files.

2.Open DGUS application new project and select correct Resolution of your DWIN Display.

3.Create Font file using Q# word bank generator tool, store the file inside project folder DWIN_SET.

4.Create .icl files for images and icons using DWIN ICL Generator tool.

5.Store the images as 32.icl and icons as 42.icl inside DWIN_SET folder of Project.

6.Using Setting --> DGUS --> CFG EDIT tool
Set Touch sound, Backlight sleep, UART Baud rate, Display default.
Touch sensitive variable Auto setting, etc --> Click New CFG and save as T5L.CFL.CFI inside DWIN_SET.

7.Add images to project.

8.Use Display control & Touch control tools to define your project.

9.File --> save and then Generate.

10.Prepare SD card maximum 16GB only supported. FAT32 format with cluster size 4096 setting.

11. Copy DWIN SET folder from your project and paste inside SD card floder.

12. Plug the SD card to your display and power up to seethe result.
